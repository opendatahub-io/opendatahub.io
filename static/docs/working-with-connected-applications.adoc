= Working with connected applications

You can extend {productname-long} capabilities by connecting to a wide range of open source and third-party applications, such as Starburst, Intel AI Tools, and IBM watsonx.ai.

You can also remove unused applications from your {productname-short} dashboard so that you can focus on the applications that you are most likely to use.
