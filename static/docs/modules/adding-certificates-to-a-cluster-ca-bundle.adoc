= Adding certificates to a cluster-wide CA bundle

[role='_abstract']
You can add a self-signed certificate to a cluster-wide Certificate Authority (CA) bundle (`ca-bundle.crt`).  

When the cluster-wide CA bundle is updated, the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) automatically detects the change and injects the updated bundle into the `odh-trusted-ca-bundle` ConfigMap, making the certificate available to {productname-short} components.

*Note:* By default, the management state for the Trusted CA bundle is `Managed` (that is, the `spec.trustedCABundle.managementState` field in the {productname-long} Operator's DSCI object is set to `Managed`). If you change this setting to `Unmanaged`, you must manually update the `odh-trusted-ca-bundle` ConfigMap to include the updated cluster-wide CA bundle.

Alternatively, you can add certificates to a custom CA bundle, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/installing-open-data-hub/#adding-certificates-to-a-custom-ca-bundle_certs[Adding certificates to a custom CA bundle].

.Prerequisites

* You have created a self-signed certificate and saved the certificate to a file. For example, you have created a certificate using OpenSSL and saved it to a file named `example-ca.crt`.
* You have cluster administrator access for the OpenShift cluster where {productname-long} is installed.
* You have installed the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI). See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI^].

.Procedure

. Create a ConfigMap that includes the root CA certificate used to sign the certificate, where `</path/to/example-ca.crt>` is the path to the CA certificate bundle on your local file system:
+
[source]
----				
oc create configmap custom-ca \
 	--from-file=ca-bundle.crt=</path/to/example-ca.crt> \
 	-n openshift-config
----


. Update the cluster-wide proxy configuration with the newly-created ConfigMap: 		
+
[source]
----				
oc patch proxy/cluster \
    	 --type=merge \
   	 --patch='{"spec":{"trustedCA":{"name":"custom-ca"}}}'
----

.Verification

Run the following command to verify that all non-reserved namespaces contain the `odh-trusted-ca-bundle` ConfigMap: 

[source]
----
oc get configmaps --all-namespaces -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=opendatahub-operator | grep odh-trusted-ca-bundle
----
