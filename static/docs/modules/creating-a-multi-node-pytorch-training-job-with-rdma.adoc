= Creating a multi-node PyTorch training job with RDMA

[role='_abstract']
NVIDIA GPUDirect RDMA uses Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) to provide direct GPU interconnect, enabling peripheral devices to access NVIDIA GPU memory in remote systems directly.
RDMA improves the training job performance because it eliminates the overhead of using the operating system CPUs and memory.
Running a training job on multiple nodes using multiple GPUs can significantly reduce the completion time.

In {productname-long}, NVIDIA GPUs can communicate directly by using GPUDirect RDMA across the following types of network: 

* Ethernet: RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) 
* InfiniBand

Before you create a PyTorch training job in a cluster configured for RDMA, you must configure the job to use the high-speed network interfaces. 


.Prerequisites

* You can access an OpenShift cluster that has multiple worker nodes with supported NVIDIA GPUs.

* Your cluster administrator has configured the cluster as follows:

ifdef::upstream[]
** Installed {productname-long} with the required distributed training components, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/installing-open-data-hub/#installing-the-distributed-workloads-components_install[Installing the distributed workloads components].

.Procedure
. Log in to the OpenShift Console.

. Create a `PyTorchJob` resource, as follows:
.. In the *Administrator* perspective, click *Home -> Search*.
.. From the *Project* list, select your project.
.. Click the *Resources* list, and in the search field, start typing `PyTorchJob`.
.. Select *PyTorchJob*, and click *Create PyTorchJob*.
+
The *Create PyTorchJob* page opens, with default YAML code automatically added.

. Attach the high-speed network interface to the `PyTorchJob` pods, as follows:

.. Edit the `PyTorchJob` resource YAML code to include an annotation that adds the pod to an additional network, as shown in the following example:
+

        metadata:
          annotations:
            k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: "example-net"
----
.. Replace the example network name `example-net` with the appropriate value for your configuration.

. Configure the job to use NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL) interfaces, as follows:

.. Edit the `PyTorchJob` resource YAML code to add the following environment variables:

        spec:
          containers:
          - command:
            - /bin/bash
            - -c
            - "your container command"
            env:
            - name: NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME
              value: "net1"
            - name: NCCL_IB_HCA
              value: "mlx5_1"
----
.. Replace the example environment-variable values with the appropriate values for your configuration:

... Set the `*NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME*` environment variable to specify the IP interface to use for communication.

... [Optional] To explicitly specify the Host Channel Adapter (HCA) that NCCL should use, set the `*NCCL_IB_HCA*` environment variable.

. Specify the base training image name, as follows:

.. Edit the `PyTorchJob` resource YAML code to add the following text:
+
.Example base training image
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
image: quay.io/modh/training:py311-cuda124-torch251
----

.. If you want to use a different base training image, replace the image name accordingly.
ifndef::upstream[]
+
For a list of supported training images, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhoai-supported-configs[{productname-long}: Supported Configurations].
endif::[]

. Specify the requests and limits for the network interface resources.
+
The name of the resource varies, depending on the NVIDIA Network Operator configuration.
The resource name might depend on the deployment mode, and is specified in the `NicClusterPolicy` resource.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must use the resource name that matches your configuration.
The name must correspond to the value advertised by the NVIDIA Network Operator on the cluster nodes.
====
+
The following example is for RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE), where the Ethernet RDMA devices are using the RDMA shared device mode.

.. Review the `NicClusterPolicy` resource to identify the `resourceName` value.
+
.Example NicClusterPolicy
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
apiVersion: mellanox.com/v1alpha1
kind: NicClusterPolicy
spec:
rdmaSharedDevicePlugin:
  config: |
    {
      "configList": [
        {
          "resourceName": "rdma_shared_device_eth",
          "rdmaHcaMax": 63,
          "selectors": {
            "ifNames": ["ens8f0np0"]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
----
+
In this example `NicClusterPolicy` resource, the `resourceName` value is `rdma_shared_device_eth`. 

.. Edit the `PyTorchJob` resource YAML code to add the following text:
+
.Example requests and limits for the network interface resources
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
            resources:
              limits:
                nvidia.com/gpu: "1"
                rdma/rdma_shared_device_eth: "1"
              requests:
                nvidia.com/gpu: "1"
                rdma/rdma_shared_device_eth: "1"
----

.. In the `limits` and `requests` sections, replace the resource name with the resource name from your `NicClusterPolicy` resource (in this example, `rdma_shared_device_eth`).

.. Replace the specified value `1` with the number that you require.
Ensure that the specified amount is available on your OpenShift cluster.

. Repeat the above steps to make the same edits in the `Worker` section of the `PyTorchJob` YAML code.

. Click *Create*.

You have created a multi-node PyTorch training job that is configured to run with RDMA.
