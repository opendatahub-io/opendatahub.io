= Creating project-scoped resources for your project

[role='_abstract']
Users can access _global resources_ in all {productname-short} projects, but can access _project-scoped resources_ within the specified project only.

A project member who is not a cluster administrator can create the following types of project-scoped resources for their {productname-short} project:

* Workbench images
* Model-serving runtimes for KServe
////
When RHOAIENG-26758 is fixed, uncomment this section, after verifying that hardware profiles and accelerator profiles are both still supported
* Hardware profiles
* Accelerator profiles
////

All resource names must be unique within a project.

[NOTE]

.Prerequisites

* You can access the {openshift-platform} console.

ifdef::upstream[]
* An {productname-short} administrator has set the `disableProjectScoped` dashboard configuration option to `false`, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/managing-resources/#customizing-the-dashboard[Customizing the dashboard].
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
* An {productname-short} administrator has set the `disableProjectScoped` dashboard configuration option to `false`, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_resources/customizing-the-dashboard[Customizing the dashboard].
endif::[]

* You can access a project in the {productname-short} console.

* You have example YAML code for the type of resource that you want to create.
+
You can get the YAML code from a trusted source, such as an existing project-scoped resource, a Git repository, or documentation.
Alternatively, you can contact your cluster administrator to request the relevant YAML code.


.Procedure
. Log in to the {openshift-platform} console.
. Copy the YAML code from a trusted source to create the resource.
+
Alternatively, if you can access an existing project-scoped resource in one of your projects, you can copy the YAML code as follows:

.. In the *Administrator* perspective, click *Home* -> *Search*.
.. From the *Projects* list, select the appropriate value.
.. In the *Resources* list, search for the relevant resource type, as follows:

* For workbench images, search for `ImageStream`.
// When RHOAIENG-26758 is resolved, remove this line and uncomment the following two lines.
// * For hardware profiles, search for `HardwareProfile`.
// * For accelerator profiles, search for `AcceleratorProfile`.
* For serving runtimes, search for `Template`. 
From the resulting list, find the templates that have the `objects.kind` specification set to `ServingRuntime`. 

.. Select a resource, and click the *YAML* tab. 
.. Copy the YAML content, and click *Cancel*.

. From the *Project* list, select your project name. Note the spelling.
. From the toolbar, click the *+* icon to open the *Import YAML* page.
. Paste the example YAML content into the code area.
. Edit the `metadata.namespace` value to specify the name of your project.
. If necessary, edit the `metadata.name` value to ensure that the resource name is unique within the specified project.
. Optional: Edit the resource name that is displayed in the {productname-short} console, as follows:

* For workbench images, edit the `metadata.annotations.opendatahub.io/notebook-image-name` value.
// When RHOAIENG-26758 is resolved, remove this line and uncomment the following line.
// * For hardware profiles and accelerator profiles, edit the `spec.displayName` value.
* For serving runtimes, edit the `objects.metadata.annotations.openshift.io/display-name` value.
. Click *Create*.


.Verification
. Log in to the {productname-short} console.
. Verify that the project-scoped resource is shown in the specified project only:
