Before you can use an accelerator in {productname-short}, you must install the relevant software components. The installation process varies based on the accelerator type.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to your {openshift-platform} cluster.
* You have the `cluster-admin` role in your {openshift-platform} cluster.
* You have installed an accelerator and confirmed that it is detected in your environment.

.Procedure
. Follow the appropriate documentation to enable your accelerator:
ifndef::upstream[]
* **NVIDIA GPUs**: See link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_accelerators/enabling-nvidia-gpus_accelerators[Enabling NVIDIA GPUs].
* **Intel Gaudi AI accelerators**: See link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_accelerators/intel-gaudi-ai-accelerator-integration_accelerators[Enabling Intel Gaudi AI accelerators].
* **AMD GPUs**: See link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_accelerators/amd-gpu-integration_accelerators[Enabling AMD GPUs].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* **NVIDIA GPUs**: See link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-accelerators/#enabling-nvidia-gpus_accelerators[Enabling NVIDIA GPUs].
* **Intel Gaudi AI accelerators**: See link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-accelerators/#intel-gaudi-ai-accelerator-integration_accelerators[Intel Gaudi AI Accelerator integration].
* **AMD GPUs**: See link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-accelerators/#amd-gpu-integration_accelerators[AMD GPU Integration].
endif::[]
. After installing your accelerator, create an accelerator profile as described in:
ifndef::upstream[]
link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_accelerators/working-with-accelerator-profiles_accelerators[Working with accelerator profiles].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-accelerators/#working-with-accelerator-profiles_accelerators[Working with accelerator profiles].
endif::[]
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, hardware profiles are hidden in the dashboard navigation menu and user interface, while accelerator profiles remain visible. In addition, user interface components associated with the deprecated accelerator profiles functionality are still displayed. To show the *Settings -> Hardware profiles* option in the dashboard navigation menu, and the user interface components associated with hardware profiles, set the `disableHardwareProfiles` value to `false` in the `OdhDashboardConfig` custom resource (CR) in {openshift-platform}.

.Verification
* From the *Administrator* perspective, go to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page. Confirm that the following Operators appear:

** The Operator for your accelerator 
** Node Feature Discovery (NFD)
** Kernel Module Management (KMM)

* The accelerator is correctly detected a few minutes after full installation of the Node Feature Discovery (NFD) and the relevant accelerator Operator. The {openshift-platform} command line interface (CLI) displays the appropriate output for the GPU worker node. For example, here is output confirming that an NVIDIA GPU is detected:
