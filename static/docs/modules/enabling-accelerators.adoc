Before you can use an accelerator in {productname-short}, you must install the relevant software components. The installation process varies based on the accelerator type.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to your {openshift-platform} cluster.
* You have the `cluster-admin` role in your {openshift-platform} cluster.
* You have installed an accelerator and confirmed that it is detected in your environment.

.Procedure
. Follow the appropriate documentation to enable your accelerator:
ifndef::upstream[]
* **NVIDIA GPUs**: See link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_accelerators/enabling-nvidia-gpus_accelerators[Enabling NVIDIA GPUs].
* **Intel Gaudi AI accelerators**: See link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_accelerators/intel-gaudi-ai-accelerator-integration_accelerators[Enabling Intel Gaudi AI accelerators].
* **AMD GPUs**: See link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_accelerators/amd-gpu-integration_accelerators[Enabling AMD GPUs].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* **NVIDIA GPUs**: See link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-accelerators/#enabling-nvidia-gpus_accelerators[Enabling NVIDIA GPUs].
* **Intel Gaudi AI accelerators**: See link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-accelerators/#intel-gaudi-ai-accelerator-integration_accelerators[Intel Gaudi AI Accelerator integration].
* **AMD GPUs**: See link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-accelerators/#amd-gpu-integration_accelerators[AMD GPU Integration].
endif::[]
. After installing your accelerator, create a hardware profile as described in:
ifndef::upstream[]
link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_accelerators/working-with-hardware-profiles_accelerators[Working with hardware profiles].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-accelerators/#working-with-hardware-profiles_accelerators[Working with hardware profiles].
endif::[]

.Verification
* From the *Administrator* perspective, go to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page. Confirm that the following Operators appear:

** The Operator for your accelerator 
** Node Feature Discovery (NFD)
** Kernel Module Management (KMM)

* The accelerator is correctly detected a few minutes after full installation of the Node Feature Discovery (NFD) and the relevant accelerator Operator. The {openshift-platform} command line interface (CLI) displays the appropriate output for the GPU worker node. For example, here is output confirming that an NVIDIA GPU is detected:
