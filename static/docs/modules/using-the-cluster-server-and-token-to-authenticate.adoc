= Using the cluster server and token to authenticate

[role='_abstract']
To interact with the OpenShift cluster, you must authenticate to the OpenShift API by specifying the cluster server and token.
You can find these values from the OpenShift Console.

.Prerequisites
* You can access the OpenShift Console.


.Procedure
. Log in to the OpenShift Console.
+
In the {productname-short} top navigation bar, click the application launcher icon (image:images/osd-app-launcher.png[The application launcher]) and then click *OpenShift Console*.
. In the upper-right corner of the OpenShift Console, click your user name and click *Copy login command*. 
. In the new tab that opens, log in as the user whose credentials you want to use.
. Click *Display Token*.
. In the *Log in with this token* section, find the required values as follows:

* The `token` value is the text after the `--token=` prefix.
* The `server` value is the text after the `--server=` prefix.

+
[NOTE]
====
The `token` and `server` values are security credentials, treat them with care.

* Do not save the token and server details in a notebook. 
* Do not store the token and server details in Git.

The token expires after 24 hours.
====

. You can use the token and server details to authenticate in various ways, as shown in the following examples:

* You can specify the values in a notebook cell:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
api_server = "__<server>__"
token = "__<token>__"
----

* You can log in to the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI) by copying the entire *Log in with this token* command and pasting the command in a terminal window.
