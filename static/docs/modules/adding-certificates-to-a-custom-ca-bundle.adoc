= Adding certificates to a custom CA bundle

[role='_abstract']
You can add self-signed certificates to a custom CA bundle that is separate from the OpenShift cluster-wide bundle. 

This method is ideal for scenarios where components need access to external resources that require a self-signed certificate. For example, you may need to add self-signed certificates to grant data science pipelines access S3-compatible object storage.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a self-signed certificate and saved the certificate to a file. For example, you have created a certificate using OpenSSL and saved it to a file named `example-ca.crt`.
* You have cluster administrator access for the OpenShift cluster where {productname-long} is installed.
* You have installed the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI). See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI^].


.Procedure
. Log in to {openshift-platform}.
. Click *Operators* â†’ *Installed Operators* and then click the {productname-long} Operator.
. Click the *DSC Initialization* tab.
. Click the *default-dsci* object.
. Click the *YAML* tab.
. In the `spec.trustedCABundle` section, add the custom certificate to the `customCABundle` field, as shown in the following example:
+
[source]
----
spec:
  trustedCABundle:
    managementState: Managed
    customCABundle: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      examplebundle123
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----
. Click *Save*.

The {productname-long} Operator automatically updates the ConfigMap to reflect any changes made to the `customCABundle` field. It adds the `odh-ca-bundle.crt` file containing the certificates to the `odh-trusted-ca-bundle` ConfigMap, as shown in the following example:

[source]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: opendatahub-operator
    config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle: 'true'
  name: odh-trusted-ca-bundle
data:
  ca-bundle.crt: |
    <BUNDLE OF CLUSTER-WIDE CERTIFICATES>
  odh-ca-bundle.crt: |
    <BUNDLE OF CUSTOM CERTIFICATES>
----

.Verification

Run the following command to verify that a non-reserved namespace contains the `odh-trusted-ca-bundle` ConfigMap and that the ConfigMap contains your `customCABundle` value. In the following command, _example-namespace_ is the non-reserved namespace and _examplebundle123_ is the `customCABundle` value. 

[source]
----
oc get configmap odh-trusted-ca-bundle -n example-namespace -o yaml | grep examplebundle123
