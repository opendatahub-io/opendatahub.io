= Using OCI containers for model storage

[role='_abstract']

As an alternative to storing a model in an S3 bucket or URI, you can upload models to Open Container Initiative (OCI) containers. Using OCI containers for model storage can help you:

* Reduce startup times by avoiding downloading the same model multiple times.
* Reduce disk space usage by reducing the number of models downloaded locally.
* Improve model performance by allowing pre-fetched images.

Using OCI containers for model storage involves the following tasks:

* Storing a model in an OCI image
* Deploying a model from an OCI image
