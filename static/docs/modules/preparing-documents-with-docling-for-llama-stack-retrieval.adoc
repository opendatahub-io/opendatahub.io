= Preparing documents with Docling for Llama Stack retrieval

[role="_abstract"]
You can transform your source documents with a Docling-enabled data science pipeline and ingest the output into a Llama Stack vector store by using the Llama Stack SDK. This modular approach separates document preparation from ingestion, yet still delivers an end-to-end, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflow.

The pipeline registers a Milvus vector database and downloads the source PDFs, then splits them for parallel processing and converts each batch to Markdown with Docling. It generates sentence-transformer embeddings from the Markdown and stores them in the vector store, making the documents instantly searchable in Llama Stack.

.Procedure
. In a new notebook cell, install the `llama_stack` client package:
+
[source,python]
----
%pip install llama_stack_client
----

. In a new notebook cell, import Agent, AgentEventLogger, and LlamaStackClient:
+
[source,python]
----
from llama_stack_client import Agent, AgentEventLogger, LlamaStackClient
----

. In a new notebook cell, assign your deployment endpoint to the `base_url` parameter to create a LlamaStackClient instance:
+
[source,python]
----
client = LlamaStackClient(base_url="<your deployment endpoint>")
----

. List the available models:
+
[source,python]
----
models = client.models.list()
----

. Select the first LLM and the first embedding model:
+
[source,python]
----
model_id = next(m.identifier for m in models if m.model_type == "llm")
embedding_model = next(m for m in models if m.model_type == "embedding")
embedding_model_id = embedding_model.identifier
embedding_dimension = embedding_model.metadata["embedding_dimension"]
----

. In a new notebook cell, define the following parameters:
* `vector_db_id`: a unique name that identifies your vector database, for example, `my_milvus_db`.  
* `provider_id`: the connector key that your Llama Stack gateway has enabled. For the Milvus vector database, this connector key is `"milvus"`. You can also list the available connectors:
+
[source,python]
----
print(client.vector_dbs.list_providers()) # lists available connectors

vector_db_id = "<your vector database ID>"
provider_id  = "<your provider ID>"
----
+
[IMPORTANT] 
====
If you are using the sample Docling pipeline from the RAG demo repository, the pipeline registers the database automatically and you can skip this step. However, if you are using your own pipeline, you must register the database yourself.
==== 

. In a new notebook cell, register or confirm your vector database to store embeddings:
+
[source,python]
----
_ = client.vector_dbs.register(
vector_db_id=vector_db_id,
embedding_model=embedding_model_id,
embedding_dimension=embedding_dimension,
provider_id=provider_id,
)
print(f"Registered vector DB: {vector_db_id}")
----

. In the {openshift-platform} web console, import the YAML file containing your docling pipeline into your data science project, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_data_science_pipelines/managing-data-science-pipelines_ds-pipelines#importing-a-data-science-pipeline_ds-pipelines[Importing a data science pipeline].

. Create a pipeline run to execute your Docling pipeline, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_data_science_pipelines/managing-data-science-pipelines_ds-pipelines#executing-a-pipeline-run_ds-pipelines[Executing a pipeline run]. The pipeline run inserts your PDF documents into the vector database. If you run the Docling pipeline from the link:https://github.com/opendatahub-io/rag/tree/main/demos/kfp/docling/pdf-conversion[RAG demo samples repository], you can optionally customize the following parameters before starting the pipeline run:

* `base_url`: The base URL to fetch PDF files from.
* `pdf_filenames`: A comma-separated list of PDF filenames to download and convert.
* `num_workers`: The number of parallel workers.
* `vector_db_id`: The Milvus vector database ID.
* `service_url`: The Milvus service URL.
* `embed_model_id`: The embedding model to use.
* `max_tokens`: The maximum tokens for each chunk.
* `use_gpu`: Enable or disable GPU acceleration.

.Verification

. In your Jupyter notebook, query the LLM with a question that relates to the ingested content. For example:   
+
[source,python]
----
from llama_stack_client import Agent, AgentEventLogger
import uuid

rag_agent = Agent(
    client,
    model=model_id,
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant",
    tools=[
        {
            "name": "builtin::rag/knowledge_search",
            "args": {"vector_db_ids": [vector_db_id]},
        }
    ],
)

prompt = "What can you tell me about the birth of word processing?"
print("prompt>", prompt)

session_id = rag_agent.create_session(session_name=f"s{uuid.uuid4().hex}")

response = rag_agent.create_turn(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    session_id=session_id,
    stream=True,
)

for log in AgentEventLogger().log(response):
    log.print()
----

. Query chunks from the vector database:
+
[source,python]
----
query_result = client.vector_io.query(
    vector_db_id=vector_db_id,
    query="what do you know about?",
)
print(query_result)
----
