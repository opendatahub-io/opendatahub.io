= About GPU time slicing

[role='_abstract']
GPU time slicing enables multiple workloads to share a single physical GPU by dividing processing time in short, alternating time slots. This method improves resource utilization, reduces idle GPU time, and allows multiple users to run AI/ML workloads concurrently in {productname-short}. The NVIDIA GPU Operator manages this scheduling based on a `time-slicing-config` ConfigMap that defines the number of GPU slices for each physical GPU.

Time-slicing differs from Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) partitioning. While MIG provides memory and fault isolation, time-slicing shares the same GPU memory across workloads without strict isolation. Time-slicing is ideal for lightweight inference tasks, data preprocessing, and other scenarios where full GPU isolation is unnecessary.

Consider the following points when using GPU time slicing:

* **Memory sharing**: All workloads share GPU memory. High memory usage by one workload can impact others.
* **Performance trade-offs**: While time slicing allows multiple workloads to share a GPU, it does not provide strict resource isolation like MIG.
* **GPU compatibility**: Time slicing is supported on specific NVIDIA GPUs.
