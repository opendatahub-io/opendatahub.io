= Preparing a storage location for the LAB-tuned model

[role='_abstract']
The LAB-tuning workflow pushes the final tuned model to an OCI-compliant registry so that it can be stored, versioned, and deployed. Before starting a LAB-tuning run, create or choose a repository in an OCI-compliant registry, configure credentials with push access, and make sure the location has enough space for the model output.

When configuring the LAB-tuning run, enter the full URI for where the LAB-tuned model will be stored (for example, `oci://quay.io/my-org/fine-tuned-model-name:version`) and provide the credentials needed to access that location by using a new or existing connection.
