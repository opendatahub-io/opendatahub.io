= Listing files in your bucket

[role='_abstract']
To list files in a specific bucket, use the `list_bucket_v2()` method. 

.Prerequisites
* You have cloned the `odh-doc-examples` repository to your workbench.
* You have opened the `s3client_examples.ipynb` file in your workbench.
* You have installed Boto3 and configured an S3 client.

.Procedure
. In the Jupyter notebook, locate the following code for listing files.
+
[source]
----
#List files
#Replace <bucket_name> with the name of the bucket.
bucket_name = ‘<bucket_name>’
s3_client.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name)
----
. Replace `<bucket_name>` with the name of your own bucket, as shown in the example, and then run the code cell.
+
[source]
----
#List files
#Replace <bucket_name> with the name of the bucket.
bucket_name = ‘aqs27-registry’
s3_client.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name)
----
+
The output displays information about the files that are available in the specified bucket.
. Locate the code cell that lists only the names of the files.
+
[source]
----
#Print only names of files
bucket_name = ‘<bucket_name>’
for key in s3_client.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name)[‘Contents’]:
	print(key[‘Key’])
----
+
. Replace `_<bucket_name>_` with the name of your bucket, as shown in the example, and run the code cell:
+
[source]
----
#Print only names of files
bucket_name = ‘aqs27-registry’
for key in s3_client.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name)[‘Contents’]:
print(key[‘Key’])
---- 
+
The output displays a list of file names that are available in the specified bucket.
. Refine the previous query to specify a file path, by locating the following code cell:
+
[source,subs="verbatim,macros",options="nowrap"]
----
bucket_name = ‘<bucket_name>’
for key in s3_client.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name,Prefix=’<start_of_file_path’)[‘Contents’]:
print(key[‘Key’])
----
. Replace `_<bucket_name>_` and `_<start_of_file_path>_` with your own values and run the code cell.
