= Troubleshooting DSPA component errors

[role='_abstract']
This table displays common errors found in DataSciencePipelinesApplication (DSPA) components, along with the associated status, message, and proposed solution. The **Ready** condition type accumulates errors from various DSPA components, providing a status view of the DSPA deployment.

|Type |Status |Error message and solution

|`ObjectStorageAvailable`

Ready
|False

False
|Error message: `Could not connect to Object Store: tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`

Solution: This issue occurs in clusters that use self-signed certificates with {productname-short} version 2.9 or later. The data science pipelines manager cannot connect to the object storage because it does not trust the object storage SSL certificate. Therefore, the pipeline server cannot be created. Contact your IT operations administrator to add the relevant Certificate Authority bundle.

|`ObjectStorageAvailable`

Ready
|False

False
|Error message: `Could not connect to Object Store
Deployment for component "ds-pipeline-pipelines-definition" is missing - prerequisite component might not yet be available.
Deployment for component "ds-pipeline-persistenceagent-pipelines-definition" is missing - prerequisite component might not yet be available.
Deployment for component "ds-pipeline-scheduledworkflow-pipelines-definition" is missing - prerequisite component might not yet be available.`

Solution: In clusters running {productname-short} 2.8.x, the data science pipelines manager might fail to connect to the object storage, and the pipeline server might not be created. 

Ensure that your object store credentials and connection information are accurate, and verify that the object store is accessible from within the data science project's associated {openshift-platform} namespace. One common issue is that the object storage SSL certificate is not trusted, particularly if self-signed certificates are used.

Verify and update your object storage credentials, then retry the operation.

|`ObjectStorageAvailable`

Ready
|False

False
|Error message: `Wrong credentials for Object Storage: Could not connect to (minio-my-project.apps.my-cluster.com), Error: The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your key and signing method.`

Solution: Provide the correct credentials for your object storage and retry the operation.

|`DatabaseAvailable`

Ready
|False

False
|Error message: `FailingToDeploy: Dial tcp XXX.XX.XXX.XXX:3306 : i/o timeout`

Solution: If the issue persists beyond startup, check for network issues or misconfigurations in the database connection settings.

|`DatabaseAvailable`

Ready
|False

False
|Error message: `Unable to connect to external database: tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`

Solution: This issue can occur when you use any external database, such as Amazon RDS. The data science pipelines manager cannot connect to the database because it does not trust the database SSL certificate, preventing the creation of the pipeline server.  Contact your IT operations administrator to add the relevant certificates.

|`DatabaseAvailable`

Ready
|False

False
|Error message: `Error 1129: Host 'A.B.C.D' is blocked because of many connection errors.`

Solution: This issue might occur when using an external database, such as Amazon RDS. Initially, the pipeline server is created successfully. However, after some time, the {productname-short} dashboard displays an "Error displaying pipelines" message, and the DSPA conditions indicate that the host is blocked due to multiple connection errors.

|`APIServerReady`

Ready
|False

False
|Error message: `Route creation failed due to lengthy project name: Route.route.openshift.io is invalid: spec.host exceeds 63 characters.`

Solution: Ensure that the project name in {openshift-platform} is less than 40 characters.

|`APIServerReady`

Ready
|False

False
|Error message: `FailingToDeploy: Component replica failed to create. Message: serviceaccount "ds-pipeline-sample" not found.`

Solution: If the failure persists for more than 25 seconds during DSPA startup, recreate the missing service account.

|`PersistenceAgentReady`

Ready
|False

False
|Error message: `FailingToDeploy: Component's replica failed to create. Message: serviceaccount "ds-pipeline-persistenceagent-sample" not found.`

Solution: If the failure persists for more than 25 seconds during DSPA startup, recreate the missing service account.

|`ScheduledWorkflowReady`

Ready
|False

False
|Error message: `FailingToDeploy: Component's replica failed to create. Message: serviceaccount "ds-pipeline-scheduledworkflow-sample" not found.`

Solution: If the failure persists for more than 25 seconds during DSPA startup, recreate the missing service account.

|`MLMDProxyReady`

Ready
|False

False
|Error message: `Deploying: Component [ds-pipeline-scheduledworkflow-sample] is still deploying.`

Solution: Wait for DSPA startup to complete. If deployment fails after 25 seconds, check the logs for further information.

== Common errors across DSP components

The following table lists errors that might occur across multiple DSPA components:

[cols="32%,8%,60%", options="header",]
|===
|Deployment condition and condition type |Status |Error message and solution
|Condition: Component Deployment Not Found

Condition type: `ComponentDeploymentNotFound`
|False
|Error message: `Deployment for component <component> is missing - prerequisite component might not yet be available.`

Solution: The deployment for the component does not exist. Typically, this issue occurs due to missing deployments or issues that occurred during creation.

|Condition: Deployment Scaled Down

Condition type: `MinimumReplicasAvailable`
|False
|Error message: `Deployment for component <component> is scaled down.`

Solution: The component is unavailable as the deployment replica count is set to zero.

|Condition: Component Failing to Progress

Condition type: `FailingToDeploy`
|False
|Error message: `Component <component> has failed to progress. Reason: <progressingCond.Reason>. Message: <progressingCond.Message>`

Solution: The deployment has stalled due to `ProgressDeadlineExceeded` or `ReplicaSetCreateError` issues, or similar.

|Condition: Replica Creation Failure

Condition type: `FailingToDeploy`
|False
|Error message: `Component's replica <component> has failed to create. Reason: <replicaFailureCond.Reason>. Message: <replicaFailureCond.Message>`

Solution: Replica creation has failed, typically due to an error in the replica set or with the service accounts.

|Condition: Pod-Level Failures

Condition type: `FailingToDeploy`
|False
|Error message: `Concatenated failure messages for each pod.`

Solution: Deployment pods are in a failed state. Check the pod logs for further information.

|Condition: Pod in CrashLoopBackOff

Condition type: `FailingToDeploy`
|False
|Error message: `Component <component> is in CrashLoopBackOff. Message from pod: <crashLoopBackOffMessage>`

Solution: Pod containers are failing repeatedly, often due to incorrect environment variables or missing service accounts.

|Condition: Component Deploying (No Errors)

Condition: type: `Deploying`
|False
|Error message: `Component <component> is deploying.`

Solution: The component deployment process is ongoing with no errors detected.

|Condition: Component Minimally Available

Condition type: `MinimumReplicasAvailable`
|True
|Error message: `Component <component> is minimally available.`

Solution: The component is available, but with only the minimum number of replicas running.
