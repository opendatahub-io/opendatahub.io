= Backing up storage data

[role='_abstract']
It is a best practice to back up the data on your persistent volume claims (PVCs) regularly.

Backing up your data is particularly important before you delete a user and before you uninstall {productname-short}, as all PVCs are deleted when {productname-short} is uninstalled.

For more information about backing up PVCs for your cluster platform, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/backup_and_restore/oadp-application-backup-and-restore.html[OADP Application backup and restore] in the OpenShift Container Platform documentation.
