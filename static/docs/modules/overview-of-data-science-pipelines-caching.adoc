= Overview of data science pipelines caching

[role='_abstract']
You can use caching within data science pipelines to optimize execution times and improve resource efficiency. Caching reduces redundant task execution by reusing results from previous runs with identical inputs. 

Caching is particularly beneficial for iterative tasks, where intermediate steps might not need to be repeated. Understanding caching can help you design more efficient pipelines and save time in model development.

Caching operates by storing the outputs of successfully completed tasks and comparing the inputs of new tasks against previously cached ones. If a match is found, {productname-short} reuses the cached results instead of re-executing the task, reducing computation time and resource usage.

== Caching criteria

For caching to be effective, the following criteria determine if a task can use previously cached results:

* *Input data and parameters*: If the input data and parameters for a task are unchanged from a previous run, cached results are eligible for reuse.
* *Task code and configuration*: Changes to the task code or configurations invalidate the cache to ensure that modifications are always reflected.
* *Pipeline environment*: Changes to the pipeline environment, such as dependency versions, also affect caching eligibility to maintain consistency.

== Viewing cached steps in the {productname-short} user interface

Cached steps in pipelines are visually indicated in the user interface (UI):

* Tasks that use cached results display a green icon, helping you quickly identify which steps were cached. The *Status* field in the side panel displays `Cached` for cached tasks.  
* The UI also includes information about when the task was previously executed, allowing for easy verification of cache usage.

To check the caching status of specific tasks, navigate to the pipeline details view in the UI. Cached and non-cached tasks are clearly indicated. Cached tasks do not display execution logs because they reuse previously generated outputs and are not re-executed.
