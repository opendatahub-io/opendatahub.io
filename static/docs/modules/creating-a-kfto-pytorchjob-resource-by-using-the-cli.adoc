= Creating a Training Operator PyTorchJob resource by using the CLI

[role='_abstract']
You can use the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI) to create a `PyTorchJob` resource to run the Training Operator PyTorch training script.


.Prerequisites

* You can access an OpenShift cluster that has multiple worker nodes with supported NVIDIA GPUs or AMD GPUs.

* Your cluster administrator has configured the cluster as follows:

ifdef::upstream[]
** Installed {productname-long} with the required distributed training components, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/installing-open-data-hub/#installing-the-distributed-workloads-components_install[Installing the distributed workloads components].
endif::[]
ifdef::self-managed[]
** Installed {productname-long} with the required distributed training components, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/installing_and_uninstalling_{url-productname-short}/installing-the-distributed-workloads-components_install[Installing the distributed workloads components] (for disconnected environments, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/installing_and_uninstalling_{url-productname-short}_in_a_disconnected_environment/installing-the-distributed-workloads-components_install[Installing the distributed workloads components]).

ifndef::upstream[]
* You can access a workbench that is suitable for distributed training, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_distributed_workloads/preparing-the-distributed-training-environment_distributed-workloads#creating-a-workbench-for-distributed-training_distributed-workloads[Creating a workbench for distributed training].

endif::[]

* You have administrator access for the data science project.
** If you created the project, you automatically have administrator access. 
** If you did not create the project, your cluster administrator must give you administrator access.

ifdef::self-managed[]
* You have downloaded and installed the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI), as described in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI^].

.Procedure
. Log in to the OpenShift CLI, as follows:

. Create a file named `train.py` and populate it with your training script, as follows:
+
.Creating the training script
[source,subs="+quotes"]
---- 
cat <<EOF > train.py 
__<paste your content here>__
EOF
----
+
Replace __<paste your content here>__ with your training script content.
+
ifndef::upstream[]
For example training scripts, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_distributed_workloads/running-kfto-based-distributed-training-workloads_distributed-workloads#example-kfto-pytorch-training-scripts_distributed-workloads[Example Training Operator PyTorch training scripts].

ifdef::upstream[]
For example training scripts, see link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-distributed-workloads/#example-kfto-pytorch-training-scripts_distributed-workloads[Example Training Operator PyTorch training scripts].

. Create a `ConfigMap` resource to store the training script, as follows:
+
.Creating the ConfigMap resource
[source,subs="+quotes"]
---- 
oc create configmap training-script-configmap --from-file=train.py -n __<your-namespace>__
----
+
Replace __<your-namespace>__ with the name of your project.

. Create a file named `pytorchjob.yaml` to define the distributed training job setup, as follows:
+
.Defining the distributed training job
[source,subs="+quotes"]
---- 
cat <<EOF > pytorchjob.py 
__<paste your content here>__
EOF
----
+
Replace __<paste your content here>__ with your training job content.

endif::[]

. Create the distributed training job, as follows:
+
.Creating the distributed training job
[source,subs="+quotes"]
---- 
oc apply -f pytorchjob.yaml
----


.Verification
. Monitor the running distributed training job, as follows:
+
.Monitoring the distributed training job
[source,subs="+quotes"]
---- 
oc get pytorchjobs -n __<your-namespace>__
----
+
Replace __<your-namespace>__ with the name of your project.

. Check the pod logs, as follows:
