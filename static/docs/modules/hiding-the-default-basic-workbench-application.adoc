= Hiding the default basic workbench application

[role='_abstract']
The {productname-short} dashboard includes *Start basic workbench* as an enabled application by default.

To hide the *Start basic workbench* tile so that it is no longer included in the list of applications on the *Applications* → *Enabled* page, edit the dashboard configuration file.

.Prerequisite

* You have {productname-short} administrator privileges.


.Procedure

. Log in to the {openshift-platform} console as an {productname-short} administrator.
. Open the dashboard configuration file:
.. In the *Administrator* perspective, click *Home* -> *API Explorer*.
.. In the search bar, enter `OdhDashboardConfig` to filter by kind.
.. Click the `OdhDashboardConfig` custom resource (CR) to open the resource details page.
.. From the *Project* list, select the {productname-short} application namespace; the default is `pass:attributes[{dbd-config-default-namespace}]`.
.. Click the *Instances* tab.
.. Click the `odh-dashboard-config` instance to open the details page.
.. Click the *YAML* tab. 
. In the `spec:notebookController` section, set the value of `enabled` to `false` to remove the *Start basic workbench* tile from the list of applications on the *Applications* → *Enabled* page.
. Click *Save* to apply your changes and then click *Reload* to make sure that your changes are synced to the cluster.

.Verification

In the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Applications* → *Enabled*. 
The list of applications no longer includes the *Start basic workbench* tile.
