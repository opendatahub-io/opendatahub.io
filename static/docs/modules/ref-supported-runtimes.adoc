= Supported model-serving runtimes

[role='_abstract']
{productname-short} includes several preinstalled model-serving runtimes. You can use preinstalled model-serving runtimes to start serving models without modifying or defining the runtime yourself. You can also add a custom runtime to support a model.

. The composite Caikit-TGIS runtime is based on link:https://github.com/opendatahub-io/caikit[Caikit^] and link:https://github.com/IBM/text-generation-inference[Text Generation Inference Server (TGIS)^]. To use this runtime, you must convert your models to Caikit format. For an example, see link:https://github.com/opendatahub-io/caikit-tgis-serving/blob/main/demo/kserve/built-tip.md#bootstrap-process[Converting Hugging Face Hub models to Caikit format^] in the link:https://github.com/opendatahub-io/caikit-tgis-serving/tree/main[caikit-tgis-serving^] repository.

. The Caikit Standalone runtime is based on link:https://github.com/caikit/caikit-nlp/tree/main[Caikit NLP^]. To use this runtime, you must convert your models to the Caikit embeddings format. For an example, see link:https://github.com/caikit/caikit-nlp/blob/main/tests/modules/text_embedding/test_embedding.py[Tests for text embedding module^].

. The *Text Generation Inference Server (TGIS) Standalone ServingRuntime for KServe* is deprecated. For more information, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/release_notes/index[{productname-long} release notes].
