= Creating a custom training image

You can create a custom training image by adding packages to a base training image.

.Prerequisites

* You can access the training image that you have chosen to use as the base for your custom image. 
ifndef::upstream[]
+
See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhoai-supported-configs[Supported Configurations] for a list of the {productname-short} base training images and their preinstalled packages.
endif::[]

* You have Podman installed in your local environment, and you can access a container registry.
+
For more information about Podman and container registries, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/building_running_and_managing_containers/index[Building, running, and managing containers].


.Procedure

. In a terminal window, create a directory for your work, and change to that directory. 

. Set the `IMG` environment variable to the name of your image.
In the example commands in this section, `my_training_image` is the name of the image.
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
export IMG=my_training_image
----

. Create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:

.. Use the `FROM` instruction to specify the location of a suitable base training image.
+
The Python version in the training image must be the same as the Python version in the workbench.

* To create a CUDA-compatible Ray cluster image, specify the location of a CUDA-compatible Ray base image, as shown in the following examples:
+
.CUDA-compatible Ray base image with Python 3.9
[source,bash]
----
FROM quay.io/modh/ray:2.35.0-py39-cu121
----
+
.CUDA-compatible Ray base image with Python 3.11
[source,bash]
----
FROM quay.io/modh/ray:2.35.0-py311-cu121
----
* To create a ROCm-compatible Ray cluster image, specify the location of a ROCm-compatible Ray base image, as shown in the following examples:
+
.ROCm-compatible Ray base image with Python 3.9
[source,bash]
----
FROM quay.io/modh/ray:2.35.0-py39-rocm61
----
+
.ROCm-compatible Ray base image with Python 3.11
[source,bash]
----
FROM quay.io/modh/ray:2.35.0-py311-rocm61
----

* To create a CUDA-compatible KFTO cluster image, specify the Developer Preview CUDA-compatible KFTO base image location:
+
.CUDA-compatible KFTO base image with Python 3.11
[source,bash]
----
FROM quay.io/modh/training:py311-cuda121-torch241
----

* To create a ROCm-compatible KFTO cluster image, specify the ROCm-compatible KFTO base image location:
+
.ROCm-compatible KFTO base image with Python 3.11
[source,bash]
----
FROM quay.io/modh/training:py311-rocm61-torch241
----



.. Use the `RUN` instruction to install additional packages.
You can also add comments to the Dockerfile by prefixing each comment line with a number sign (`#`).
+
The following example shows how to install a specific version of the Python PyTorch package:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Install PyTorch
RUN python3 -m pip install torch==2.4.0
----


. Build the image file. 
Use the `-t` option with the `podman build` command to create an image tag that specifies the image name and version, to make it easier to reference and manage the image: 
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
podman build -t _<image-name>_:_<version>_ -f Dockerfile
----
+
Example:
+
[source,bash]
----
podman build -t ${IMG}:0.0.1 -f Dockerfile
----
+
The build output indicates when the build process is complete.

. Display a list of your images:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
podman images
----
+
If your new image was created successfully, it is included in the list of images.

. Push the image to your container registry:
+
[source,bash]
----
podman push ${IMG}:0.0.1
----

. Optional: Make your new image available to other users, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_distributed_workloads/managing-custom-training-images_distributed-workloads#pushing-an-image-to-the-integrated-openshift-image-registry_distributed-workloads[Pushing an image to the integrated OpenShift image registry].
