= Enabling AMD GPUs

[role='_abstract']
Before you can use AMD GPUs in {productname-short}, you must install the required dependencies, deploy the AMD GPU Operator, and configure the environment.

.Prerequisites
ifdef::upstream,self-managed[]
* You have logged in to {openshift-platform}.
* You have the `cluster-admin` role in {openshift-platform}.
* You have installed your AMD GPU and confirmed that it is detected in your environment.
* Your {openshift-platform} environment supports EC2 DL1 instances if you are running on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-service[]
* You have logged in to OpenShift.
* You have the `cluster-admin` role in OpenShift.
* You have installed your AMD GPU and confirmed that it is detected in your environment.
* Your {openshift-platform} environment supports EC2 DL1 instances if you are running on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
endif::[]

.Procedure
. Install the latest version of the AMD GPU Operator, as described in link:https://instinct.docs.amd.com/projects/gpu-operator/en/latest/installation/openshift-olm.html[Install AMD GPU Operator on OpenShift].
. After installing the AMD GPU Operator, configure the AMD drivers required by the Operator as described in the documentation: link:https://instinct.docs.amd.com/projects/gpu-operator/en/latest/drivers/installation.html[Configure AMD drivers for the GPU Operator].

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can install the AMD GPU Operator from the {org-name} Catalog. For more information, see link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/container-stacks/detail/6722781e65e61b6d4caccef8?rh-tabs-2b5yslu8z=rh-tab-v8le4ijlp[Install AMD GPU Operator from Red Hat Catalog].
====

//downstream - all
ifndef::upstream[]
. After installing the AMD GPU Operator, create an accelerator profile, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_accelerators/#working-with-accelerator-profiles_accelerators[Working with accelerator profiles].
endif::[]

//upstream only
ifdef::upstream[]
. After installing the AMD GPU Operator, create an accelerator profile, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-accelerators/#working-with-accelerator-profiles_accelerators[Working with accelerator profiles].
endif::[]

.Verification
From the *Administrator* perspective, go to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page. Confirm that the following Operators appear:

* AMD GPU Operator
* Node Feature Discovery (NFD)
* Kernel Module Management (KMM)

[NOTE]
====
Ensure that you follow all the steps for proper driver installation and configuration. Incorrect installation or configuration may prevent the AMD GPUs from being recognized or functioning properly.
