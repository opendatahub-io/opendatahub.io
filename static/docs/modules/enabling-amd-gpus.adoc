= Enabling AMD GPUs

[role='_abstract']
Before you can use AMD GPUs in {productname-short}, you must install the required dependencies, deploy the AMD GPU Operator, and configure the environment.

.Prerequisites
ifdef::upstream,self-managed[]
* You have logged in to {openshift-platform}.
* You have the `cluster-admin` role in {openshift-platform}.
* You have installed your AMD GPU and confirmed that it is detected in your environment.
* Your {openshift-platform} environment supports EC2 DL1 instances if you are running on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-service[]
* You have logged in to OpenShift.
* You have the `cluster-admin` role in OpenShift.
* You have installed your AMD GPU and confirmed that it is detected in your environment.
* Your {openshift-platform} environment supports EC2 DL1 instances if you are running on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

.Procedure
. Install the latest version of the AMD GPU Operator, as described in link:https://instinct.docs.amd.com/projects/gpu-operator/en/latest/installation/openshift-olm.html[Install AMD GPU Operator on OpenShift].
. After installing the AMD GPU Operator, configure the AMD drivers required by the Operator as described in the documentation: link:https://instinct.docs.amd.com/projects/gpu-operator/en/latest/drivers/installation.html[Configure AMD drivers for the GPU Operator].

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can install the AMD GPU Operator from the {org-name} Catalog. For more information, see link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/container-stacks/detail/6722781e65e61b6d4caccef8?rh-tabs-2b5yslu8z=rh-tab-v8le4ijlp[Install AMD GPU Operator from Red Hat Catalog].

//downstream - all
ifndef::upstream[]
. After installing the AMD GPU Operator, create an accelerator profile, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_accelerators/#working-with-accelerator-profiles_accelerators[Working with accelerator profiles].
endif::[]

//upstream only
ifdef::upstream[]
. After installing the AMD GPU Operator, create an accelerator profile, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-accelerators/#working-with-accelerator-profiles_accelerators[Working with accelerator profiles].
endif::[]
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, hardware profiles are hidden in the dashboard navigation menu and user interface, while accelerator profiles remain visible. In addition, user interface components associated with the deprecated accelerator profiles functionality are still displayed. To show the *Settings -> Hardware profiles* option in the dashboard navigation menu, and the user interface components associated with hardware profiles, set the `disableHardwareProfiles` value to `false` in the `OdhDashboardConfig` custom resource (CR) in {openshift-platform}.

.Verification
From the *Administrator* perspective, go to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page. Confirm that the following Operators appear:

* AMD GPU Operator
* Node Feature Discovery (NFD)
* Kernel Module Management (KMM)

[NOTE]
====
Ensure that you follow all the steps for proper driver installation and configuration. Incorrect installation or configuration may prevent the AMD GPUs from being recognized or functioning properly.
