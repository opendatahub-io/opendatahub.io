= Running the fine-tuning job

[role='_abstract']
When you run a training job to tune a model, you must specify the resources needed, and provide any authorization credentials required. 

[NOTE]
====
The code in this procedure specifies how to run the example fine-tuning job. 
If you have the specified resources, you can run the example code without editing it.

Alternatively, you can modify the example code to specify the appropriate details for your fine-tuning job.
====

.Prerequisites

* You can access an OpenShift cluster that has sufficient worker nodes with supported accelerators to run your training or tuning job.
+
The example fine-tuning job requires 8 worker nodes, where each worker node has 64 GiB memory, 4 CPUs, and 1 NVIDIA GPU.

* You can access a workbench that is suitable for distributed training, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_distributed_workloads/preparing-the-distributed-training-environment_distributed-workloads#creating-a-workbench-for-distributed-training_distributed-workloads[Creating a workbench for distributed training].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* You can access a workbench that is suitable for distributed training, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-distributed-workloads/#creating-a-workbench-for-distributed-training_distributed-workloads[Creating a workbench for distributed training].
endif::[]

* You have administrator access for the data science project.
** If you created the project, you automatically have administrator access. 
** If you did not create the project, your cluster administrator must give you administrator access.

* You have access to a model.
* You have access to data that you can use to train the model.

ifndef::upstream[]
* You have configured the fine-tuning job as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_distributed_workloads/running-kfto-based-distributed-training-workloads_distributed-workloads#configuring-the-fine-tuning-job_distributed-workloads[Configuring the fine-tuning job].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* You have configured the fine-tuning job as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-distributed-workloads/#configuring-the-fine-tuning-job_distributed-workloads[Configuring the fine-tuning job].
endif::[]

* You can access a dynamic storage provisioner that supports ReadWriteMany (RWX) Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) provisioning, such as link:https://www.redhat.com/fr/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift-data-foundation[{org-name} OpenShift Data Foundation].

* A `PersistentVolumeClaim` resource named `shared` with RWX access mode is attached to your workbench.

* You have a Hugging Face account and access token.
For more information, search for "user access tokens" in the link:https://huggingface.co/docs[Hugging Face documentation^].


.Procedure
. Open the workbench, as follows:
.. Log in to the {productname-long} web console.
.. Click *Data science projects* and click your project.
.. Click the *Workbenches* tab. 
If your workbench is not already running, start the workbench.
.. Click the *Open* link to open the IDE in a new window. 

. Click *File -> Open*, and open the notebook that you used to configure the fine-tuning job.

. Create a cell to run the job, and add the following content:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
client.create_job(
    job_kind="PyTorchJob",
    name="sft",
    train_func=main,
    num_workers=8,
    num_procs_per_worker="1",
    resources_per_worker={
        "nvidia.com/gpu": 1,
        "memory": "64Gi",
        "cpu": 4,
    },
    base_image="quay.io/modh/training:py311-cuda121-torch241",
    env_vars={
        # Hugging Face
        "HF_HOME": "/mnt/shared/.cache",
        "HF_TOKEN": "",
        # CUDA
        "PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF": "expandable_segments:True",
        # NCCL
        "NCCL_DEBUG": "INFO",
        "NCCL_ENABLE_DMABUF_SUPPORT": "1",
    },
    packages_to_install=[
        "tensorboard",
    ],
    parameters=parameters,
    volumes=[
        V1Volume(name="shared",
            persistent_volume_claim=V1PersistentVolumeClaimVolumeSource(claim_name="shared")),
    ],
    volume_mounts=[
        V1VolumeMount(name="shared", mount_path="/mnt/shared"),
    ],
)
----

. Edit the `HF_TOKEN` value to specify your Hugging Face access token.
+
Optional: If you specify a different model, and your model is not a gated model from the Hugging Face Hub, remove the `HF_HOME` and `HF_TOKEN` entries.

. Optional: Edit the other content to specify the appropriate values for your environment, as follows:

.. Edit the `num_workers` value to specify the number of worker nodes.
.. Update the `resources_per_worker` values according to the job requirements and the resources available.
.. The example provided is for NVIDIA GPUs. If you use AMD accelerators, make the following additional changes:

* In the `resources_per_worker` entry, change `nvidia.com/gpu` to `amd.com/gpu`
* Change the `base_image` value to `quay.io/modh/training:py311-rocm62-torch241`
* Remove the `CUDA` and `NCCL` entries

.. If the RWX `PersistentVolumeClaim` resource that is attached to your workbench has a different name instead of `shared`, update the following values to replace `shared` with your PVC name:

* In this cell, update the `HF_HOME` value.
* In this cell, in the `volumes` entry, update the PVC details:
** In the `V1Volume` entry, update the `name` and `claim_name` values.
** In the `volume_mounts` entry, update the `name` and `mount_path` values.

ifndef::upstream[]
* In the cell where you set the training parameters, update the `output_dir` value.
+
For more information about setting the training parameters, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_distributed_workloads/running-kfto-based-distributed-training-workloads_distributed-workloads#configuring-the-fine-tuning-job_distributed-workloads[Configuring the fine-tuning job].

. Run the cell to run the job.


.Verification
View the progress of the job as follows:

. Create a cell with the following content:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
client.get_job_logs(
    name="sft",
    job_kind="PyTorchJob",
    follow=True,
)
----

. Run the cell to view the job progress.
