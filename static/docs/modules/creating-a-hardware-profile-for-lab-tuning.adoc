= Creating a hardware profile for LAB-tuning

[role='_abstract']
Configure a GPU hardware profile in {productname-short} that users can select when launching a LAB-tuning run.

A GPU hardware profile is required to run LAB-tuning workloads in {productname-short}. LAB-tuning uses distributed training that must be scheduled on nodes with GPU resources. A GPU hardware profile allows users to target specific GPU-enabled worker nodes when launching pipelines, ensuring that training workloads run on compatible hardware.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to {productname-short} as a user with administrator privileges.
* The relevant hardware is installed and you have confirmed that it is detected in your environment.
