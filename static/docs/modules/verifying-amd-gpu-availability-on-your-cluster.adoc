= Verifying AMD GPU availability on your cluster

[role='_abstract']
Before you proceed with the AMD GPU Operator installation process, you can verify the presence of an AMD GPU device on a node within your {openshift-platform} cluster. You can use commands such as `lspci` or `oc` to confirm hardware and resource availability.

.Prerequisites
* You have administrative access to the {openshift-platform} cluster.
* You have a running {openshift-platform} cluster with a node equipped with an AMD GPU.
* You have access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) and terminal access to the node.

.Procedure
. Use the OpenShift CLI to verify if GPU resources are allocatable:
.. List all nodes in the cluster to identify the node with an AMD GPU:
+
----
oc get nodes
----
.. Note the name of the node where you expect the AMD GPU to be present.
.. Describe the node to check its resource allocation:
+
----
oc describe node <node_name>
----
.. In the output, locate the **Capacity** and **Allocatable** sections and confirm that `amd.com/gpu` is listed. For example:
+
----
Capacity:
  amd.com/gpu:  1
Allocatable:
  amd.com/gpu:  1
----
. Check for the AMD GPU device using the `lspci` command:
.. Log in to the node:
+
----
oc debug node/<node_name>
chroot /host
----
.. Run the `lspci` command and search for the supported AMD device in your deployment. For example:
+
----
lspci | grep -E "MI210|MI250|MI300"
----
.. Verify that the output includes one of the AMD GPU models. For example:
+
----
03:00.0 Display controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] Instinct MI210
----
. Optional: Use the `rocminfo` command if the ROCm stack is installed on the node:
+
----
rocminfo
----
.. Confirm that the ROCm tool outputs details about the AMD GPU, such as compute units, memory, and driver status.

.Verification
* The `oc describe node <node_name>` command lists `amd.com/gpu` under **Capacity** and **Allocatable**.
* The `lspci` command output identifies an AMD GPU as a PCI device matching one of the specified models (for example, MI210, MI250, MI300).
* Optional: The `rocminfo` tool provides detailed GPU information, confirming driver and hardware configuration.
