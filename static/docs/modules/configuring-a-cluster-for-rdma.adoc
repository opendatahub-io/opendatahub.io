= Configuring a cluster for RDMA

[role='_abstract']
NVIDIA GPUDirect RDMA uses Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) to provide direct GPU interconnect.
To configure a cluster for RDMA, a cluster administrator must install and configure several Operators.

.Prerequisites

* You can access an OpenShift cluster as a cluster administrator.

* Your cluster has multiple worker nodes with supported NVIDIA GPUs, and can access a compatible NVIDIA accelerated networking platform.


ifdef::upstream[]
* You have installed {productname-long} with the required distributed training components as described in link:{odhdocshome}/installing-open-data-hub/#installing-the-distributed-workloads-components_install[Installing the distributed workloads components].
endif::[]

ifdef::self-managed[]
* You have installed {productname-long} with the required distributed training components as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/installing_and_uninstalling_{url-productname-short}/installing-the-distributed-workloads-components_install[Installing the distributed workloads components] (for disconnected environments, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/installing_and_uninstalling_{url-productname-short}_in_a_disconnected_environment/installing-the-distributed-workloads-components_install[Installing the distributed workloads components]).

.Procedure
. Log in to the OpenShift Console as a cluster administrator.

. Enable NVIDIA GPU support in {productname-short}.

This process includes installing the Node Feature Discovery Operator and the NVIDIA GPU Operator.

. Enable NVIDIA GPU support in {productname-short}.

This process includes installing the Node Feature Discovery Operator and the NVIDIA GPU Operator.
For more information, see link:https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/index.html[NVIDIA GPU Operator on {org-name} OpenShift Container Platform^] in the NVIDIA documentation.

[NOTE]
====
After the NVIDIA GPU Operator is installed, ensure that `rdma` is set to `enabled` in your `ClusterPolicy` custom resource instance.
====

. To simplify the management of NVIDIA networking resources, install and configure the NVIDIA Network Operator, as follows:

.. Install the NVIDIA Network Operator, as described in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/latest/html/operators/administrator-tasks#olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster[Adding Operators to a cluster] in the OpenShift documentation.

.. Configure the NVIDIA Network Operator, as described in the deployment examples in the link:https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/display/cokan10/network+operator[Network Operator Application Notes] in the NVIDIA documentation.


. [Optional] To use Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) deployment modes, complete the following steps:
.. Install the SR-IOV Network Operator, as described in the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/latest/html/networking/networking-operators#installing-sriov-operator[Installing the SR-IOV Network Operator] section in the OpenShift documentation.

.. Configure the SR-IOV Network Operator, as described in the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/latest/html/networking/networking-operators#configuring-sriov-operator[Configuring the SR-IOV Network Operator] section in the OpenShift documentation.

. Use the Machine Configuration Operator to increase the limit of pinned memory for non-root users in the container engine (CRI-O) configuration, as follows:

.. In the OpenShift Console, in the **Administrator** perspective, click **Compute -> MachineConfigs**. 
.. Click **Create MachineConfig**.
.. Replace the placeholder text with the following content:
+
.Example machine configuration
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
  name: 02-worker-container-runtime

              [crio.runtime]
              default_ulimits = [
                "memlock=-1:-1"
              ]
          mode: 420
          overwrite: true
          path: /etc/crio/crio.conf.d/10-custom
----
.. Edit the `default_ulimits` entry to specify an appropriate value for your configuration.
For more information about default limits, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6243491[Set default ulimits on CRIO Using machine config] Knowledgebase solution.
.. Click **Create**.
.. Restart the worker nodes to apply the machine configuration.

+
This configuration enables non-root users to run the training job with RDMA in the most restrictive OpenShift default security context.


.Verification
. Verify that the Operators are installed correctly, as follows:
.. In the OpenShift Console, in the **Administrator** perspective, click **Workloads -> Pods**.
.. Select your project from the *Project* list.
.. Verify that a pod is running for each of the newly installed Operators.
. Verify that RDMA is being used, as follows:
.. Edit the `PyTorchJob` resource to set the `*NCCL_DEBUG*` environment variable to `INFO`, as shown in the following example:
+

        spec:
          containers:
          - command:
            - /bin/bash
            - -c
            - "your container command"
            env:
            - name: NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME
              value: "net1"
            - name: NCCL_IB_HCA
              value: "mlx5_1"
            - name: NCCL_DEBUG
              value: "INFO"
----
.. Run the PyTorch job.
.. Check that the pod logs include an entry similar to the following text:
+
.Example pod log entry
