[role='_abstract']

In {productname-short}, cluster administrators create Kueue resources to configure quota management for distributed workloads.
Cluster administrators can optionally configure the CodeFlare Operator if they want to change its default behavior.

[NOTE]
====
The minimum version of {openshift-platform} that is compatible with Kueue 0.10.1 is 4.15. 
If you deploy {productname-long} 2.18 or later on {openshift-platform} 4.14 or earlier, you must disable the API Priority and Fairness configuration for the Visibility API, as described in the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/#enabling-disabling-api-priority-and-fairness[Enabling/Disabling API Priority and Fairness] section in the Kueue _Cluster Administration_ guide.
This modification is required because the `PriorityLevelConfiguration` API is incompatible with older {openshift-platform} versions.
