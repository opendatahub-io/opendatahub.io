= Preparing the distributed training environment

[role='_abstract']

Before you run a distributed training or tuning job, prepare your training environment as follows:

* Create a workbench with the appropriate workbench image.
Review the list of packages in each workbench image to find the most suitable image for your distributed training workload.
* Ensure that you have the credentials to authenticate to the OpenShift cluster.
* Select a suitable training image.
Choose from the list of base training images provided with {productname-long}, or create a custom training image.

For information about the workbench images and training images provided with {productname-long}, and their preinstalled packages, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhoai-supported-configs[{productname-long}: Supported Configurations] Knowledgebase article.
