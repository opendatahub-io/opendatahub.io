= Evaluating large language models

[role='_abstract']

A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) program that is designed for natural language processing tasks, such as recognizing and generating text.

As a data scientist, you might want to monitor your large language models against a range of metrics, in order to ensure the accuracy and quality of its output.  Features such as summarization, language toxicity, and question-answering accuracy can be assessed to inform and improve your model parameters.

Open Data Hub now offers Language Model Evaluation as a Service (LM-Eval-aaS), in a feature called LM-Eval. LM-Eval provides a unified framework to test generative language models on a vast range of different evaluation tasks. 


The following sections show you how to create an `LMEvalJob` custom resource (CR) which allows you to activate an evaluation job and generate an analysis of your model's ability.
